intel graphic card 
The general concept of enabling Intel graphics cards:

Correct the names of all related devices (IGPU for the video card itself, IMEI for the Intel Management Engine).
If necessary, fake the device-id's of the video card and Intel Management Engine to compatible ones.
Specify the correct framebuffer (AAPL,ig-platform-id or AAPL,snb-platform-id) describing available outputs and other properties of the video card.
Add some other additional properties to devices related to Intel® HD Graphics аnd for digital audio.
At this point, paragraphs 1 and 4 are automated by WhateverGreen and AppleALC. It works in OS X 10.8 and later, and greatly simplifies graphics enabling in macOS.	


when install hackintosh without format i happen to could not complete the installation with the error the image currepted and not complete ,so better to format the disk if need a fresh new installation


1. backlight fixed

the apple backlight need the pnlf device before loading the applebacklight kext to work,
with whatevergreen we don't need the kext from rehabman applebacklightfix.kext and ssdt-pnlf.aml acpi file to fix 
just use use whatevergreen and  addpnlf from clover acpi/fix

2.use whatevergreen follow all the instruction on the whatevergreen but keep the add properties from clover plist from rehabman if delete the add properties it will not boot up

3.without some files in side the acip patched path (dsdt.aml ssdt-gprw.aml ssdt-pnlf.aml) it won't wake after sleep update: the dead sleep cause by not the nvidia graphics card ,if the n card not disabled after sleep it won't resume to normal mode

4.finally fixed the instant wake problem (the usb 06 and 00 skylake and rename _dsm method)
update( patch dsdt with "add Rename _DSM methods to XDSM" first and then patch "usb_prw_0x0d_xhc.txt" and "usb_prw_0x6d_xhc.txt" the skylake one ) will totally fix the instant wake issue


5.android studio avd not able to boot to fix reboot to bios for vt setting enable it


6. weir thing that when using the usb drive to boot the audio will not work almost all the time ,but did work on the ssd drive

7.sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.airport.bt.plist bluetoothCoexMgmt Hybrid   this can improve the 2.4ghz wifi and bluetooth interfere
